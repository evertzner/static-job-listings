## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Redux

### What I learned

I use this project to have a big focus on react, redux and improving designing technics.

Partial SCSS to have organized styling in modules.

### Continued development

I want to get more in deep into Redux as it is a powerful tool to manage data into an application.
